        <h2 className="section-heading">1. A Friendly Introduction</h2>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Hello there! Welcome to <strong>eHealthReport</strong> ("us," "we," or "the company that really hopes you're having a nice day").
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          These Terms of Service (or as we like to call them, "The Rules of the Road") govern your journey through our website at eHealthReport. We've tried to make them as painless as possible—kind of like a trip to the dentist where they actually have the good flavors of toothpaste.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Our Privacy Policy is also part of this agreement (it's like the sidekick to these Terms' superhero). Together they explain how we'll treat your information with the care it deserves.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          By using our service, you're nodding along to these terms. If you find yourself vigorously shaking your head instead, that's okay! Just please don't use our service, and maybe drop us a line at <a href="mailto:contact@ehealthreport" className="link">contact@ehealthreport</a> so we can see if there's another path forward. We're reasonable folks, we promise.

        <p className="paragraph">
          When you use eHealthReport, you're agreeing to receive newsletters and updates from us. Think of them less as "marketing materials" and more like "friendly letters from that pen pal who's really excited about document conversion."
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Not your cup of tea? No problem! You can unsubscribe faster than you can say "no more emails please" by clicking the unsubscribe link or emailing <a href="mailto:contact@ehealthreport" className="link">contact@ehealthreport</a>.

        <h2 className="section-heading">3. Money Matters</h2>
        <p className="paragraph">
          If you decide to purchase something from us (thank you, by the way!), we'll need some payment information. We promise we're not collecting card numbers for fun—we actually need them to process your payment.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          By providing your payment details, you're confirming that:
        </p>
        <ul className="list">
          <li className="list-item">You have the legal right to use that payment method (borrowing your roommate's credit card without permission is a no-no)</li>
          <li className="list-item">All the information you've given us is accurate (no need to pretend you live at "123 Fake Street")</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="paragraph">
          We work with trusted third-party payment processors who help make the money magic happen. When you submit your payment info, you're giving us permission to share it with these companies, subject to our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          We reserve the right to cancel orders for reasons including product availability, pricing errors, or suspected fraud. It's not that we don't trust you—we just need to keep things on the up-and-up.

      <section className="policy-section">
        <h2 className="section-heading">4. Subscriptions: The Gift That Keeps on Giving</h2>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Some of our services require a subscription (think of it like a membership to your favorite club, but with fewer awkward holiday parties).
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Here's how it works:
        </p>
        <ul className="list">
          <li className="list-item">You'll be billed in advance on a recurring basis</li>
          <li className="list-item">Your subscription will automatically renew (like magic, except you get charged)</li>
          <li className="list-item">You can cancel anytime through your account or by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@ehealthreport" className="link">contact@ehealthreport</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p className="paragraph">
          We need valid payment information to process your subscription. If your payment method fails, we may have to terminate your access to the service. Not to be dramatic, but please keep your payment info up to date!
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Section 5 */}
      <section className="policy-section">
        <h2 className="section-heading">5. Free Trials: Try Before You Buy</h2>
        <p className="paragraph">
          eHealthReport occasionally on its sole discretion offer free trials of our subscription services to some of our users. It's like test-driving a car, but with fewer salespeople hovering nearby.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Important notes about free trials:
        </p>
        <ul className="list">
          <li className="list-item">We might ask for your billing info when you sign up</li>
          <li className="list-item">If you provide billing info, you won't be charged until the trial ends</li>
          <li className="list-item">If you don't cancel before the trial expires, we'll automatically start billing you</li>
          <li className="list-item">We reserve the right to modify or cancel free trial offers at any time</li>

      {/* Section 6 */}
      <section className="policy-section">
        <h2 className="section-heading">6. Fee Changes: The Only Constant is Change</h2>
        <p className="paragraph">
          We may modify our subscription fees from time to time. When we do, the new rates will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Don't worry—we're not sneaky. We'll give you advance notice of any price changes so you can decide whether to continue your subscription. If you keep using the service after a price change, that signals your acceptance of the new fee.

        <p className="paragraph">
          We offer refunds within 14 days of purchase. Like returning a sweater that looked better online than it does on you—no hard feelings.
